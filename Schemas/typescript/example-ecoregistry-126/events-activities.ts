  // phases of the Karapınar Solar Power Plant Project in line with Kalyon Energy's
  // Social Development Policy commitments. this program offers ways for especially
  // communities close to the project site to benefit from the positive effects of the

  {
    // In April 2021, the project site was opened for grazing for sheep for a while, and 8
    // animal crossing ramps were built for sheep to pass through concrete borders. The
    // company has started experiments to support the successful implementation of
    // grazing within solar energy plants by developing a viable business model. These experiments involve grazing flocks of sheep in the Karapınar Solar Power Plant area.
    // In Turkey, the practice of opening solar power plant areas for grazing is not yet
    // widespread among plant operators.3
  }
  {
    // The first grazing trial took place on August 10, 2023, between 06:00 AM and 07:00
    // AM, with a flock of around 70 sheep, and it was successfully completed. The
    // following day, another trial was conducted using a flock of approximately 300
    // sheep under the solar panels.
  }
  {
    // As of August 21, 2023, grazing experiments continue with a flock of 600 sheep, and
    // the continuation of these trials is planned. In Turkey, the practice of opening solar
    // power plant areas for grazing is not yet widespread among plant operators. This is
    // mainly due to lack of information, fear of innovation, and numerous
    // misconceptions. There is a common concern that sheep might damage solar
    // energy installations. However, according to the companies literature research,
    // grazing with sheep, particularly aside from goats and cattle, does not harm the
    // solar panels and does not pose any security risks from the perspective of the
    // sheep. The field studies conducted so far also support this data.(See Annex 3)

  // Each of the following is an activity in its own:
  // * Food boxes were donated to 100 households in need during Ramadan.
  // • Saplings were planted by participating in the sapling planting event organized by
  // the Karapınar Municipality.
  // • A Kalyon Energy Memorial Forest with 10000 saplings is being built.
  // • On 1.09.2021, an environmental cleaning event was held in Acıgöl with the project
  // employees.
  // • On 23.09.2021, the Red Crescent blood donation truck came to the project site and
  // a blood donation event was held for 2 days.
  // • In order to draw attention to the importance of seat belts in traffic on 28.10.2022,
  // a traffic activity was organized with a simulation tool for the project employees
  // and the people of Karapınar.
  // • In the project, 773 employees completed the vocational training process and their
  // documents were delivered by the Karapınar Public Education Center.
  // • In the campuses close to the project, dust and noise measurements are made from
  // 2 points for 5 days.
  // • A teacher's lodge is being built by Kalyon Energy in the city center of Karapınar
  // • Student trips to the project are organized frequently.
