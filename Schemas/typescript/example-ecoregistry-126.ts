      In April 2021, the project site was opened for grazing for sheep for a while, and 8
animal crossing ramps were built for sheep to pass through concrete borders. The
company has started experiments to support the successful implementation of
grazing within solar energy plants by developing a viable business model. These experiments involve grazing flocks of sheep in the Karapınar Solar Power Plant area.
In Turkey, the practice of opening solar power plant areas for grazing is not yet
widespread among plant operators.3
    }
    {
      The first grazing trial took place on August 10, 2023, between 06:00 AM and 07:00
AM, with a flock of around 70 sheep, and it was successfully completed. The
following day, another trial was conducted using a flock of approximately 300
sheep under the solar panels.
    }
    {
      As of August 21, 2023, grazing experiments continue with a flock of 600 sheep, and
the continuation of these trials is planned. In Turkey, the practice of opening solar
power plant areas for grazing is not yet widespread among plant operators. This is
mainly due to lack of information, fear of innovation, and numerous
misconceptions. There is a common concern that sheep might damage solar
energy installations. However, according to the companies literature research,
grazing with sheep, particularly aside from goats and cattle, does not harm the
solar panels and does not pose any security risks from the perspective of the
sheep. The field studies conducted so far also support this data.(See Annex 3)

    // Konya province,Karapınar district on a 19.2 km2 land. The project is designed as a greenfield
    // solar photovoltaic power plant and the produced energy will be fed into the Turkish
    // national grid. The project is the largest solar power plant within the Turkey with the 1000
    // MWe2 capacity.The project start production on the 20/09/2020.The implementation of
    // the project lasted approximately three years and it is concluded on the 01/03/2023. The
    // project aims to generate electricity by using solar power to supply the increasing national
    // electricity demand in a cleaner and sustainable manner. It reduces the air pollution caused
    // by the grid connected power plants which are mostly fossil fuel fired.
    // The project is expected to contribute 4 SDGs which are SDG 7, 8, 11 and 13.
