Since Turkey's grid mainly consists of thermal power plants, this has resulted in GHG emissions. Therefore baseline emissions for this project include only CO2 emissions from electricity generation in fossil fuel fired power plants that are displaced due to the project activity.",

However according to ACM0002 Version 21.0 para 61 ,these emission sources can be neglected, therefore there are no leakage emissions related to project activity. There is also no Project emission in the Project which is detailed in the section 3.2.",
