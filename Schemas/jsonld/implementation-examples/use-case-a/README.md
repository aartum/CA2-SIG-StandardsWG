The examples in this folder are for a marketplace use case where there is the need to distinguish between different layers of detail and data access permissions. In this exemplary use case we distinguish between three such layers:
(a) layer 1: public, summary information - just enough to price and trade the right to make the associated impact claim;
(2) layer 2: public, detailed information - intended for market actors who are interested in the details of the project design and the impact verification processes that were followed for a specific monitoring period;
(3) layer 3: private information and raw data - may comprise sensitive, personal information about agents and beneficiaries, and raw or voluminous data (such as sensor readings).
